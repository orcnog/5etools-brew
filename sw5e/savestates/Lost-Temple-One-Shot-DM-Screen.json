									"One of several precursors to the AT-ST walker, the AT-RT was 3.2 meters tall and 2.9 meters long, with a saddle-like seat for a single clone trooper driver. Its open cockpit design made the driver especially vulnerable to sniper fire, a notable flaw, but low costs and good visibility of the battlefield made up for this shortcoming. While other walkers like the AT-PT eliminated the flaw of the exposed driver position, the AT-PT was slower, and this made the AT-RT competitive with the former as it was capable of tremendous speeds and could also leap quite a distance thanks to its light construction.",
									"The recon walker was equipped with a nose-mounted repeating blaster cannon and mortar launcher, both of which made the walker a formidable anti-infantry unit, although a group of five walkers could easily overpower a single AAT. The AT-RT was fitted with a motion detection scanner and sensor equipment capable of providing Forward Command Centers with updated situation reports from the battlefield.",
									"AT-RTs could be deployed to the battle field in various ways. They were usually deployed from landed Acclamator-class assault ship, but this wasn't always practical for size reasons. When this occurred, they could be deployed by LAAT/is, 1 per gunship stored on the speeder bike ramp, 2 could be carried if the crew bay was empty.",
									"The walkers could also be deployed from modified AT-TEs with special cargo lifts in their back section. They could transport 2 Walkers and their riders. ARF Troopers were known to pilot these walkers."

												"The {@b Dawn of Defiance} campaign opens some months after the rise of the Empire, with the Clone Wars a very recent and vivid memory for most beings in the galaxy. The Empire has begun tightening its grip on star systems throughout the galaxy, and Darth Vader stands at the newly declared Emperor's right hand, crushing any opposition and hunting down the last remnants of the Jedi Order. In these short months since the fall of the Republic, many have joined the Empire willingly, including the Core Worlds whose Human nobles stand to benefit a great deal from its tyranny. Similarly, many others have begun rebelling against Imperial oppression, finding themselves driven out of their homes (or worse) and forced to live in a galaxy that tolerates no opposition to the Empire. Throughout the {@b Dawn of Defiance} campaign, the heroes must deal with the reality that the Empire is a monolithic threat without any kind of organized opposition, and dealing with agents of the Empire can be dangerous.",
												"Despite the difficulties the heroes face in terms of Imperial dominance, they are in a unique position to deal the first significant blow against the Empire. In the first adventure, the heroes will come face to face with the man who will become their clandestine benefactor, Senator Bail Organa. In the new Empire, seditious acts are punished harshly, and as such the heroes will find that they must be extremely cautious in their actions. With nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, the heroes of the {@b Dawn of Defiance} campaign may find that a one-way trip to Kessel is the best they can hope for if they fall into the hands of the Empire.",
												"The first act of the campaign (comprised of the first three adventures — {@i The Traitor's Gambit}, {@i {@adventure A Wretched Hive|orcnogDoDEp2}}, and {@i {@adventure The Queen of Air and Darkness|orcnogDoDEp3}}) introduces the heroes to one another and to some of the key figures in the campaign. Over the course of the first arc, the heroes discover that the Empire has a secret project in the works that could have dire consequences for the galaxy if it comes to fruition. Thanks to the help of former Imperial Admiral Gilder Varth, whom the heroes should rescue at the conclusion to the first adventure, the heroes learn that the Empire's secret project has left a trail of money and slaves that they can follow to find the truth. During the first three adventures, the heroes travel to famous planets such as Alderaan, Bespin, Cato Neimoidia, and Felucia, fighting Imperial stormtroopers, destroying secret labs and prisons, encountering vile Hutt gangsters, and participating in a dangerous sabacc tournament where the buy-in might be more than they can afford. The first adventure, The Traitor's Gambit, is relatively straightforward, allowing the heroes to become accustomed to one another and the SW5e rules. Each subsequent adventure leads the heroes down new paths and introduces different playstyles.",
												"Certain kinds of heroes will find it easier than others to flourish in the {@b Dawn of Defiance} campaign. First and foremost, the heroes should view the Empire as both a threat and an enemy. As the major villainous entity of the campaign, the Empire represents something that is to be feared and loathed, and characters with Imperial sympathies will likely find themselves in conflict with the overarching plot. Otherwise, the heroes can come from almost any background and profession. As long as they are willing to fight against the Empire (both covertly and openly), they should find the campaign engaging and exciting. Not every hero needs to be an idealistic freedom fighter; smugglers, bounty hunters, and free traders have just as much to gain from weakening the Empire as rebellious troops do. If the heroes' motivation is personal profit or increasing their own power, they could do worse than to work for Bail Organa. Not only is he rich, but he is also powerful and influential, and his influence could very easily be transferred to any heroes that get on his good side."

Based on this information, the heroes are hired (as friends of Bail Organa, enemies of the Empire, or freelance entrepreneurs) to fly to the planet Felucia and discover the fate of a turncoat Imperial Admiral. If the Admiral still lives, they are to bring him back to Alderaan.",

The heroes prepare to set off for the prison when a cry goes up in the village—a scout trooper has just spotted the village and is headed back to alert the Empire! This leads into a chase scene in which the heroes ride kybucks in pursuit of the scout trooper. Once the trooper has been stopped, the heroes convince the Felucians to lead them to the Imperial base immediately so that they can rescue the Admiral and stop bringing danger to the hidden village.",

Once inside the base, the heroes find it more lightly guarded (and more along the lines of what they can handle). During the search for Admiral Varth, the heroes come across a communication from Imperial Naval Command indicating that Inquisitor Draco is en route to Felucia to take custody of the Admiral. The heroes fight their way through the facility and eventually find Admiral Varth in the detention block. They free him and head back to the secret entrance where their Felucian guide supposedly awaits their return.",

About this time, {@creature Sirona O'Keefe|orcnogDoDEp1|Captain O'Keefe} sends the heroes a message: She has completed repairs to her ship and can pick them up when they are ready. On their way to the roof, the heroes must deal with the cruel Captain Vischera and his genetically modified bodyguards. Once they reach the roof, they board Okeefe's ship and blast off from Felucia.",

There, the heroes are introduced to the Nebulon-B frigate {@i Resurgence}, which has been commissioned by Organa to serve as a mobile hiding place for the Admiral. Aboard the {@i Resurgence}, Admiral Varth is debriefed and provides the heroes and Senator Organa with information related to a top-secret Imperial project."

In addition to stormtroopers and Imperial officers, Brentaal's planetary security force keeps a watchful eye on everything that happens on Sel Zonn Station. The planetary security force gets along well enough with the Empire, though questions of jurisdiction have caused tension between the two in the past. For the most part, the planetary security force operates out of the local security office, where it keeps a number of cells open for criminals and malcontents. Those captured by the Empire, however, are incarcerated in the security office briefly before being transported via shuttle to the planet's surface. Customs enforcement is relatively light simply because large cargo haulers cannot dock with the station. As such, usually only a single customs officer is on hand for any cargo inspection.",
												"The main commercial area of Sel Zonn Station is known as the Promenade. Filled with shops of all kinds, as well as large, open seating areas with fountains, plants, and other decorations, the Promenade is where Brentaal's nobles and other station visitors go to enjoy themselves. Security is tight on the Promenade, and Imperial forces are on hand at all times to keep the peace. Additionally, the Empire tries to keep the area free of aliens, and as such they harass any non-Humans moving about the Promenade. Although they won't go so far as to arrest anyone, they often try to start fights with aliens just to have an excuse to lock them up. For this reason, most non-Humans tend to stay clear of the Promenade, except on rare occasions."

The Devaronian is clearly terrified o what awaits him at the palace, but he is also afraid of the heroes, and a such he does not make any escape attempts. Raden has a speeder tha can fit three passengers (or six, if they pile in on top of one another) and he wastes no time in zooming through the bridge city, weaving i and out of ruined buildings and taking shortcuts through the rubble. Th trip to Darga's palace takes half an hour, and Raden's winding cours leads the heroes into a dense cluster of buildings that blocks out thei view of the Cato Neimoidian sky.",

In fact, on first approach, there seems to be nothing of importance in the area. But on closer inspection, it becomes clear that the Hutt's palace is cobbled together from former Neimoidian estates. The entrance to the palace is a pair of massive blast doors, 5 meters tall and carved with elaborat Hutt runes, set into the front wall. The doors appear to be unguarded.",
												"Raden walks timidly up to one door, which has a smal communications panel. He presses a button, sputters some phrases i Huttese (\"This is Raden. I've come to deliver news to the mighty Darga. With all due respect, I require an audience.\"), and steps back, fidgetin nervously. A long, quiet moment passes before two Nikto with huntin blaster rifles appear on battlements above the doors, weapons at th ready and pointed down at the visitors. A metal panel in the blast doo scrapes as it is pulled aside, and a pair of glowing red eyes appear in th slit. A gravelly voice echoes from within the doors, again in Huttes (\"You're in for it now, Raden. Darga is expecting visitors, all right, bu those creatures are not them.\"), and the panel slams closed. A momen later, there is a heavy clank of metal on metal, and the blast doors par to either side. A rush of cold, dry air flows outward from the Hutt' palace, and Raden motions the heroes to follow him inside.",
												"Entering the palace, there is no sign of who or what might hav owned the glowing red eyes seen through the door panel. (They belon to Igren Demos, the Neimoidian majordomo, though the heroes won' learn that until later.) The heroes follow Raden down a long, dar hallway illuminated at seemingly random intervals by torches set i sconces on the walls. Anyone passing through this hallway, including th heroes, feels that something is watching them from the darkness.",
												"Unmarked metal doors are set into the walls at various points, and th air is thick with the smell of dust and rotting wood.",
												"Moving deeper into the palace, the heroes get the sense that th building was once bright and beautiful. Any character who makes successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Lore}) check can tell that muc of the architecture and trim is Neimoidian in design, and it become clear that the palace probably once belonged to a high-ranking membe of the Trade Federation, perhaps an advisor to Nute Gunray.",

A raised dais in the center of the room supports the massive bulk of Darga the Hutt, and behind his dais a large, open balcony seems to extend into darkness."

Silence reigns as every eye turns to watch Raden lead the visitors into an open space in front of the opulent dais. Darga's eyes roll from the heroes to Raden, then sharpen quickly with anger. He booms something in Huttese at the Devaronian (\"What is the meaning of bringing outsiders here?\"), who immediately begins groveling, begging for the Hutt's forgiveness as th rest of the court hoots with laughter and derision. Darga cuts him off with a harsh word (\"Silence!\") and calls for his protocol droid, {@creature 3PO Series Protocol Droid|orcnogSW5e|TC-663}. From this point on, Darga begins addressing the heroes directly, using {@creature 3PO Series Protocol Droid|orcnogSW5e|TC-663} as a translator.",
												"Darga's giant eyes rest on them all for a long moment before th Hutt demands to know why they have come to his palace and how the convinced Raden to escort them. Darga is satisfied with any answer tha is not confrontational. He really isn't looking for trouble with the heroes he just wants to feel them out and see if they could be useful in som way. He's already impressed with their ability to locate his hidden palac (though it may not seem like much of a feat, there are many in Darga' own organization who couldn't manage it) and wants to discove whether they have any skills that he could exploit.",
												"Darga begins this encounter indifferent to the heroes. If they ca shift his attitude to friendly somehow, he welcomes them into his court.",
												"Any flattery grants the heroes favorable circumstances on Persuasio checks to alter the Hutt's attitude, as do bribes or gifts of any kind. If th heroes mention that they are seeking employment or are interested i providing their services, they gain favorable circumstances on Deceptio checks against the crime lord. Darga is still building up his power bas and is always on the lookout for potentially valuable members of hi organization. If the heroes fail their Persuasion check to join the court they can still join by offering bribes or other incentives, though Darg expects at least 1,000 credits' worth before he even considers it.",
												"Once the heroes have satisfied his curiosity, Darga invites them to join him at court for a short while. He has many matters to attend t over the next few days, and he is expecting visitors besides, but he i more than happy to let them stick around. Darga plans to impress th heroes with his wealth and power, hoping to convince them that  business relationship would be profitable. This is exactly the kind o thing the heroes need to get close to the Hutt and snoop around. If th heroes agree to remain at the palace, Darga calls for a feast and offer them a large amount of delicious (and expensive) food and drink. As th feast begins, two of Darga's Gamorrean guards drag Warrick Raden of to the dungeons so that he can \"think about his betrayal.\" During the feast, Darga asks many questions about the heroes: wh they are, where they come from, what their exploits are, and so on. He also gives them a chance to ask questions, but he graciously deflects any questions about his business practices for now. He lets one thing slip however—if the heroes mention the Empire, Darga boasts that one of th visitors he is expecting is an Imperial agent. The Hutt seems to think tha this will impress the heroes, though he reveals little more than the fact that the Empire is sending a delegate to his court sometime in the nex few days.",
												"Over the course of the meal, the heroes get the impression that while Darga is trying to win them over with his opulence, he is als testing to see whether they have anything to offer him. He drops hint with remarks such as, \"We will see how you enjoy your time in m court—and how much I enjoy your company,\" or \"The next few days wil give us a chance to get to know each other and see how much I have t offer you—and you to offer me!\"",

												"All work and no play makes Darga a dull Hutt—a motto the crime lord firmly stands by—and at a certain point, he calls for some diversion. One of Darga's favorite activities is droid racing, wherein several members of his court compete for his favor while controlling droids in a race around the gladiator arena. Some years ago, a smuggling ship in Darga's employ returned from the edges of the Unknown Regions with advanced droid interface technology. Instead of turning the technology over to scientists, Darga had his own technicians use it to create toys for his amusement. The result is a set of racing droids, each of which can be controlled remotely by donning a visor that allows the pilot to \"see\" out of the droid's electronic eyes.",
												"Unfortunately, the droid interfaces have some drawbacks. They are notoriously difficult to control and require intense focus and mental acuity to get any kind of result. Worse, in some cases, major damage to one of the racing droids has produced dangerous sensory feedback that has nearly scrambled the minds of the pilots. Despite this, Darga insists that members of his court take turns piloting the droids. He rewards the victor handsomely and makes no secret of his delight when a droid is wrecked and the pilot's mind damaged.",
												"The races take place in Darga's gladiator arena; barricades are set up to create a winding track that doubles back on itself to form a large, bending course. Within the course, artificial ramps and pits make it all the more likely that a racing droid will crash. As the course is being set up, Darga invites one of the heroes to pilot his personal racing droid. When pressed, Darga reveals that his last pilot has yet to recover from an injury he sustained during the race (\"But you shouldn't have anything to worry about. Ho, ho, ho, ho!\"). He promises a reward to the winner, and three more members of his court come forward to try their hand at a racing droid: one of the Quarren, a Gamorrean guard, and the Neimoidian majordomo Igren Demos.",

														"At this point, one of the heroes has a chance to pilot a racing droid. Each of the droids seems fragile, and Darga allows the hero who volunteers some time to get acquainted with the interface. During this time, the other members of the party might be able to provide assistance through Secondary Challenges. The droid is piloted through a simple system of visual commands, but managing those commands while keeping an eye on the track is challenging.",
														"The race consists of three laps around the track. For each lap, each pilot makes an Intelligence ({@skill Piloting}) check. The highest result earns 4 speed points, the second highest earns 3 speed points, the next highest earns 2 speed points, and the lowest earns a single speed point. Additionally, a roll of a natural 1 on the ({@skill Piloting}) check automatically comes in last place, causing the pilot to lose 1 speed point. At the end of the race (after three ({@skill Piloting}) checks), the pilot with the highest number of speed points wins the race.",
														"However, no underground race would be complete without a few dirty tricks. Once per lap, any pilot can make his droid attack another racing droid. To do this, the pilot declares that his droid tries to attack another droid and wagers 1 to 4 speed points. The pilot can wager more speed points than he currently owns, but failure has its consequences. The pilot then makes an attack roll for his droid (1d20 + the number of speed points wagered) against an AC of 13. Success indicates that the target droid is damaged by the attack; the attacking pilot gains a number of speed points equal to the number wagered, while the defending pilot loses that same number of speed points. Failure indicates that the attacker loses the number of speed points wagered. Regardless of whether the attack succeeds or fails, the attacking pilot earns 1 less speed point on his next lap.",
														"Any racing droid that has fewer than 0 speed points crashes and is destroyed. The control visor overloads, make the pilot roll a DC 15 Constitution saving throw with a failed save giving 1 level of exhaustion. If the \"Hidden Enemies\" or \"Discovering Denia\" encounters (page 14) happen later the same day, the race might be a chance for the piloting hero to impose a level of exhaustion on the Quarren assassins or Igren Demos. That would give the heroes a small advantage when dealing with those opponents in the later encounter.",
														"The winner of the race receives a gaudy necklace valued at about 500 credits. In truth, a hero who enters the race does not actually need to win to curry Darga's favor; participation is enough to gain the Hutt's approval. If the heroes refuse to participate, the race proceeds without them, and Igren Demos wins handily. Darga is not impressed with the heroes, remarking on their timidity, but it does not hurt their chances in other events."

When she arrives, flanked by her two guards, Darga rolls his eyes meaningfully in the heroes' direction and then greets the newcomers (\"Always a pleasure to serve the Empire! What can I do for you today?\"). Neither the agent nor her guards seem to notice the Hutt's glance toward the heroes.",
														"The Imperial liaison wastes no time and launches into a spiel about the transfer of Tibanna gas from Darga's holdings to the Empire. She insists that while Darga's supplies have been sufficient thus far, the Empire needs him to step up his production of refined Tibanna gas immediately. As the heroes should come to understand, Darga has been shipping the gas (which is used in producing blaster and turbolaser bolts) to the Empire in substantial quantities, and now they want more . The liaison offers the Hutt an 80% increase in payments for a 100% increase in output, claiming that it is more than fair since he will be making more money overall.",
														"Additionally, she makes two other propositions. First, the Empire is willing to offer a further 20% increase in payments if the Hutt accepts the increase in \"biological\" resources. Though she really means slaves, she does not come out and say so, and the heroes might not connect this statement with the complaints of the Iron Ring slavers. (It's fine if they don't; the full extent of the sordid deal will be exposed in the next adventure, {@adventure The Queen of Air and Darkness|orcnogDoDEp3} .)",
														"Second, the liaison offers to provide Darga with a personal Imperial security retinue as a sign of their continued good faith. The Hutt would have an Imperial regiment stationed in the city of Zarra, and a flight of Imperial starfighters would escort him when traveling off-world.",
														"At this point, Darga turns to the heroes for advice. If the heroes have not set up a private method of communicating with the Hutt, Darga dismisses the Imperials temporarily so they won't overhear the discussion. If the heroes provide him with the advice he wants to hear, they can earn his favor. Of the three proposals, Darga believes that the first one is sound (more money coming in at only a slight discount) and the latter two are not. The slaves he has been getting from the Empire are used up, and payments in credits are more reliable in the long run. Additionally, the promised security retinue seems like little more than a plot to expand Imperial influence on Cato Neimoidia and keep the Hutt under the Imperial Security Bureau's watchful eye.",
														"If the heroes make the correct recommendation (\"yes\" on the increased production, \"no\" on the increased payment in biological resources, and \"no\" on the Imperial retinue) for two out of the three options, Darga is suitably impressed by their keen minds, and they will have gained more favor with the crime lord."

Since the discovery of Denia will probably conclude the heroes' time in Darga's palace, do not rush in introducing this event.",

One of the Separatist generals had her unconscious form brought to this palace and placed in an artificial coma while they decided what to do with her. When the Clone Wars came to an abrupt end, the Separatists fled the palace and left the Jedi behind. Darga moved in soon after and discovered Denia's comatose body. Never one to throw away a potential resource, Darga had her moved to the lowest levels of the palace and kept unconscious, thinking that there might come a day when she could prove useful. When the heroes arrived, Denia could sense their presence even while unconscious (either because one or more of the heroes is Force sensitive, or because destiny swirls about them), and she reaches out to them for help.",

If the heroes stay in Darga's palace after their time in his court, one or two of them begin to hear whispers in their sleep, so strongly that they awaken. If the heroes appear to be making plans to leave, you can have them hear the whispers while awake. The voice, clearly that of a woman, says things such as, \"Help me,\" and \"I know you can hear me.\" If the heroes attempt to ignore the whispers, the voice becomes more insistent, begging for help and pleading with them to find her.",
												"If the heroes search for a way to find the whispers, they discover that the voice becomes stronger if they descend through the guest quarters into the lower reaches of the palace. If the heroes curried Darga's favor and were given the datacard to access the secret way in and out of the guest quarters, they can also use it to access a turbolift to the lower levels of the guest quarters. The turbolift leads them directly to the chambers where Denia is being held.",
