Replacing a power generator takes an action.\r\n\r\nBefore firing the blaster cannon, you must deploy it using an action unless you meet its strength requirement. Alternatively, if youâ€™re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this action replaces one of them.  While deployed in this way, you treat this weaponâ€™s strength number as two steps less (from 19 to 15), your speed is reduced by half, and you cannot fire this weapon at long range. You can collapse the blaster cannon as an action or bonus action."

The shelter includes spikes that automatically mount to the ground, provided they can find purchase. The shelter comes with an integrated power generator, faint glowing lights in the interior which provide dim light, and creatures in the shelter are protected from the elements, including hot and cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The shelter's power generator lasts for seven days, after which it stops providing light. The shelter can be collapsed and restored over the course of 10 minutes."

				"The flechette cannon does not make attack rolls. Rather than traditional power cells, the flechette cannon uses specialized projector tanks, which, when fired, spray an area with the contents of the tank. Projector tanks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tankï¿½s effects. It can have different ammunition types loaded simultaneously, and you can choose which ammunition youï¿½re using as you fire it (no action required). If you donï¿½t meet the flechette cannonï¿½s strength requirement, creatures have advantage on their saving throws. If you lack proficiency in the flechette cannon, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total."

For each saving throw you fail, the size of your Hit Die is reduced by one step (from d12 to d10, from d10 to d8, from d8 to d6, from d6 to d4, or from d4 to d2). If you fail a saving throw while your Hit Die is a d2, you die as the orbalisks consume you. Additionally, for each saving throw you fail, your AC increases by 1. For each saving throw you succeed, the size of your Hit Die increases by one step (from d2 to d4, from d4 to d6, from d6 to d8, from d8 to d10, or from d10 to d12). Additionally, for each saving throw you succeed, your AC decreases by 1. The size of your Hit Die can not exceed the Hit Dice granted by your class, and your AC can not be increased or reduced more than the number of Hit Die increases or reductions.   {@i This armor is comprised of a series of small parasitic creatures called orbalisks. Over time, orbalisks reproduce until they cover the entirety of their host.}"

Additionally, you can attempt to listen in on nearby audio communications chatter such as from a comlink or holocomm as an action. Make an Intelligence (Technology) check, DC determined by the GM depending on the sophistication of the technology. On a success, you can hear electronic communications originating from within 100 feet. - {@b Respirator Mode:} This includes a basic respirator that grants advantage on saving throws made to avoid being poisoned and resistance to poison damage. Additionally, you do not need air to breathe, allowing you to survive even in vacuum for up to 1 hour.  {@b Side Effect:} This complex interface causes significant interference with other communication devices, rendering them impossible to use. While this implant is installed, you can not use any portable device used for communication or jamming, such as a commlink or holotrace device.  }This sleek, stark white device adorned with a small antenna attaches to the back of the otherwise bulky S3 module._"

On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.  A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a DC 13 Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.  While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).  Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action."

				"<p>You sublimate yourself before the will of the Force, attempting to use it to affect change in the galaxy around you. </p>\n<p>The basic use of this power is to duplicate any other light side or universal force power of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that power; it simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You summon one object to you of up to 250,000 cr in value that isn't an enhanced item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\n<li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the <em>improved restoration</em> power.</li>\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single power or other specific enhanced effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to the Manifestation of Abeloth's Will ability.</li>\n<li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, <em>will of the force</em> could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This power might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary enhanced item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\n<p>The stress of casting this power to produce any effect other than duplicating another power weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a power until you finish a long rest, you take {@damage 1d10} necrotic damage per level of that power, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. Additionally, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for {@damage 2d4} days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Additionally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast <em>will of the force</em> ever again if you suffer this stress. Finally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points as a result of this necrotic damage, or at any point before you have fully recovered from the Strength reduction, you immediately die and cannot be resurrected as your body fades away, absorbed into the living Force.</p>"
