# 5etools-brew
My converted and homebrewed content for 5etools

## The Witchlight Carnival

A jaunt through the Witchlight Carnival, taken from the Wild Beyond the Witchlight adventure. This modified version excludes the rest of the full adventure into the Feywild, and provides a standalone version of the carnival that can be dropped into any campaign.  The payoff (if the players *need a reason* to blow off some steam in a low-stakes carnival) is that if they play their cards right, they are invited to travel through a portal, *not* to the Feywild, but to a pocket dimension containing only one thing: a really cool magic shop.  Call it what you like, but mine is named "Fantasy Costco"  (also stolen material! all credit to The Adventure Zone!) Hilarious and powerful custom magic items await the players who are crowned the Witchlight Monarch at the carnival.

ToDos:
- Need to finish writing the section on Fantasy Costco.
- Write a quick conclusion.

## SW5e

 [SW5e](https://SW5e.com) is an RPG system based on 5e SRD rules that fit into a Star Wars universe. My goal is ***not*** to convert the entire system for 5etools. Currently the only SW5e data I have converted is that which is needed to run Dawn of Defiance, Episodes 1 and 2, with the exception of spells, which (only because I was able to write a script to convert them in bulk from the Foundry SW5e system compendium) I have actually converted *all*.  Or at least all that were in the Foundry SW5e system as of late May, 2022.  I have also converted some monsters (again only those seen in DoD Ep1 & 2) but have no plans presently to convert *all* SW5e monsters from [Scum and Villainy](https://sw5e.com/rules/snv), unless I can find a script that does it in bulk too.  Again, this is by no means a full SW5e system conversion.  Maintaining that would certainly be too big of a job for one man who's only planning to run some converted Saga Edition adventures a few times a year.  I invite anyone who wants to take that on to reach out--I'm more than willing to share the data I have, and if I know there's help I may be willing to pitch in.

ToDos:
- Would love to import more items. Specifically weapons/armor.
- Maybe custom races (species) could be set up.  It's not really nec to run adventures imo, but i'm a bit of a completionist.
- Are custom alignments a thing?  because right now, all the creatures are converted to good/evil/neutral instead of the SW5e terminology of "light/dark/balanced"
- if there's more to be done with the custom currency (Credits), i'd like to investigate.  Currently, i've just set up the global meta data for that and defined a conversion rate to copper, the standard 5etools currency unit, but I'm not sure if it's usable in homebrew yet beyond that.
- Steatch Goal (a big one): write a script that can convert from the SW5eAPI to 5etools json.  Maybe start light, with *items* or something.  If I can get that working, maybe move on to spells, then maybe even creatures.
- Update on ^ this stretch goal... It is indeed a big one, and *Items* was NOT a light start. Items are all tiny little blank slates of non-comforming data [sigh]. That said, I have a terrific start on this, albeit probably stale now since I haven't touched it in a couple of years.  I'll get back to it eventually&trade;

## Dawn of Defiance, Episode I: The Traitor's Gambit

This adventure was originally written for Star Wars Role Playing Game: Saga Edition, and has been converted (mostly by [Stormchaser](https://www.gmbinder.com/profile/stormchaser)) to work in the [SW5e](https://SW5e.com) system.  I've converted the GMBinder text, and defined all of the creatures, items, and even the currency (Galactic credits).  I've done nothing to define the broader system meta data for things like classes, species, or starships, I have only defined the data needed for a DM to run the adventure out of 5etools.

ToDos:
- I need to link all the skills and items in the text with tooltip tags.  Ex: {@skill Perception}
- I plan to create a few starship statblocks, even though there are SW5e rules that don't map 1:1 with traditional DnD5e. I plan to define all the "Starship Action"s simply as "Traits".  Should be good enough to make the statblock usable.
- I plan to upload the remastered maps from this [Imgur folder](https://imgur.com/user/peterptero)
- Stretch goal: I'd like to set up map data (more than just uploading the map images). I haven't learned how to do that just yet.

## Dawn of Defiance, Episode II: A Wretched Hive

For the next leg of the adventure, I set up several more SWRPG:Saga Edition creatures (mostly, or totally? converted to SW5e by [Mishy](https://www.gmbinder.com/profile/mishy)), and set up *all* of the (currently defined) Force Powers and Tech Powers.  If you DM anything like me, you really rely on those spell tooltips mid-session.  I've also set up custom skills (like piloting, and Mechanic's Kit), and the custom "spell schools" of Force Power: Lightside, Force Power: Darkside, and Tech Powers.

ToDos:
- Starships
- Remastered maps
- Map data (stretch)
