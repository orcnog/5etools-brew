# 5etools-brew
My converted and homebrewed content for 5etools

## The Witchlight Carnival

A jaunt through the Witchlight Carnival, taken from the Wild Beyond the Witchlight adventure. This modified version excludes the rest of the full adventure into the Feywild, and provides a standalone version of the carnival that can be dropped into any campaign.  The payoff (if the players need a reason to blow off some steam in a low-stakes carnival) is that if they play their cards right, they are invited to travel through a portal, *not* to the Feywild, but to a pocket dimension containing only one thing: a really cool magic shop.  Fantasy Costco (also stolen material! credit to The Adventure Zone!) awaits the players who are crowned the Witchlight Monarch.

## Dawn of Defiance, Episode II: A Wretched Hive

This adventure was originally written for Star Wars Role Playing Game: Saga Edition, and has been converted (mostly by [Mishy](https://www.gmbinder.com/profile/mishy)) to work in the [SW5e](https://SW5e.com) system.  The original Mishy conversion was appropriate for SW5e players of level 3-ish, but I've increased the DCs and CRs to make this adventure appropriate for level 5, since that's what level my players will be when I run it for them.

## SW5e Creatures

Currently the only SW5e creatures I have converted for 5etools are those which are used in Dawn of Defiance, Episode II: A Wretched Hive.  I may also convert Episode I: The Traitor's Gambit soon (just because I'm a completionist. I've already run it for my 3 different DnD groups =O), and if so, I'll add a few more creatures from that adventure.  But I have no plans presently to convert *all* SW5e monsters from [Scum and Villainy](https://sw5e.com/rules/snv).  That would probably require creating the meta data to support SW5e Tech Powers, Force Powers, custom skills, custom damage types, etc.  Too big of a job for one man who's only planning to run some converted Saga Edition adventures a few times a year.  I invite anyone who wants to take that on to reach out--I'm more than willing to share the data I have, and if I know there's help I may be willing to pitch in.
