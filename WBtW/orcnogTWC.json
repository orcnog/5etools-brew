This shop, whose name I shall not utter, is not easily found, and its wares do not come cheap.  For I was only able to acquire my prize by bartering for it. The item was tarnished brass framed spectacle, unassuming in appearance, but it granted the wearer the ability to find what they were looking for, be it lost items, clues, or even hidden treasures. The asking price was well beyond my means, so I struck a deal: in exchange for this ring, I traded 38 years of my life. At the budding young age of 20, it seemed like a fair deal at the time. But now look at me. Nearing death. I look and feel all of 90, when I'm actually in my 50's. I gambled away my twilight years for a parlor trick trinket that I've now... [sigh]... lost.  Yes, it's true.  The only item in my posession that I could {@i possibly lose}... Oh the irony.  I have such regret, I cannot stand it.\"",
														"Madryck looks up at you with aged, sagging eyes. \"Please. I implore you to return to the magic shop and try to buy back some of my life. Take this and try to sell it to the shop keeper in exchange for as many years of my life as he'll trade for it. It's not much but since losing my spectacle, I've slowly had to sell off my treasures, and this ring is now all I have to trade.\" Madryck extends a shaky arm and opens his hand to reveal a small wooden ring. \"It is imbued with the magical gift of animal kinship. The wearer can speak with birds and beasts, and gains influence over them when needed.\" He forces a smile, \"In the right hands it really could be quite powerful!\" he says enthusiastically, doing his best to promote the ring's worth. \"Please convince the shop keep of its considerable value.\"",
														"\"Know that this magic shop is not simple to find. It exists in a pocket dimension between planes, and can only be accessed one way: Every eight years, our world is visited by a traveling extravaganza called the Witchlight Carnival, and hidden somewhere in the carnival is a doorway to the magic shop. The exact location of this portal changes constantly, but rest assured that {@i someone} always knows where it is.  The Carnival has recently returned to this world and is camped closeby, just outside of Phandalin. I'm asking you now because the carnival might pack up and leave at any time, and it contains your only route to the dimensional crossing where you'll find the magic shop, whose terrible name I fear to utter aloud.",

But they dare not play a part in making that dream a reality.
